To adapt the pseudo-code to the actual data, we will need to follow these steps:

Fetching Data: Use the provided Spotify integration functions to fetch data.
Data Preprocessing: Convert the textual data into a numerical format (probably one-hot encoding for categorical variables like genres and label encoding for names), and scale numerical features.
Data Structuring: Structure the data into a format suitable for the neural network (look into pandas data frame).
Feature and Target Definition: Define the features (X) and targets (y) for the neural network, this works with what we have for the inputs we have chosen.
Dataset Splitting: Split the dataset into training and test sets.
Model Training: Train the neural network model on the training set.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model on the test set to determine its performance.
