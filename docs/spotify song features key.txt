Spotify song features key:

Instrumentalness
    -	Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. "Ooh" and "aah" sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. 
        Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly "vocal". The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content.
        Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.

Key
    -	The key the track is in. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation. E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on. 
        If no key was detected, the value is -1.

Loudness
    -	The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful 
        for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological 
        correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typically range between -60 and 0 db.

Tempo
    -	The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace 
        of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.

Danceability
    -	Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo,
         rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.

Energy
    -	Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, 
        energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. 
        Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.

Genres
